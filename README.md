# 🕰️ Event Countdown (Manila Time)

An event countdown timer meticulously designed for an iOS-inspired aesthetic. Built with a focus on typography and fluid motion, this timer is synchronized specifically to ***Philippine Standard Time (Manila, UTC+8)***, ensuring accuracy regardless of the user's local device settings.

## ✨ Features

* **iOS Aesthetic**: A clean, monochromatic design using glassmorphism, subtle gradients, and JetBrains Mono typography.

### Dynamic Modes:
* **New Year**: Auto-calculates the next January 1st.
* **Christmas**: Auto-calculates the next December 25th.
* **Custom Events**: Set your own event title, target date/time, and a personalized celebration message via a sleek modal.
* **Immersive Celebration**: High-performance HTML5 Canvas fireworks erupt in full color when the timer hits zero.
* **Fluid Responsiveness**: Utilizes CSS clamp() logic to ensure the interface scales perfectly from an iPhone SE to 4K desktop monitors.
